<h2>My Best 3 Movies </h2>

<h3>2 Broke Girls</h3>
<p>This is truly my favorite drama show ever since my high school, and is still unforgetable to me. The drama has perfectly portrait a good sense of black humor and the real life for most people living in the cities. This drama certainly could chill my day and sweep my bad mood away. Highly recommended to watch!</p>

<h3>Selena Gomez's Kitchen</h3>
<p>Totally love this reality show. It's truly fascinating to see my super idol hosting a Kitchen show. I've enjoyed how Selena connect with the Chefs and family interaction in the show.</p>


<h3>Fifty Shade of Grey</h3>
<p>This is a mix of romantic and twisted movie, showing you a unusual way of love relationship</p>
